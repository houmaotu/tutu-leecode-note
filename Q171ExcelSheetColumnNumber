Question:

Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...

idea:
26-ary number conversion

code:
class Solution:
    def titleToNumber(self, columnTitle: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        for s in columnTitle:
            res = res*26 + (ord(s)-ord('A')+1)
        return res
        
comments:
it's easier to use ord to convert leters to its unicode, and use the difference to get the nums
