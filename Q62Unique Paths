题目：
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

思路：
就算打死我 这也是初中奥数！！！

代码：
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        line = [1 for _ in range(m)]
        ct = 1
        while ct < n:
            line [0] = 1
            for i in range(1,m):
                line[i] += line[i - 1]
            ct += 1
        return line[-1]
        
知识点：
      明明就是组合数搞定的事情 就楞超界！阶乘大我也没办法啊！真是太难受了
