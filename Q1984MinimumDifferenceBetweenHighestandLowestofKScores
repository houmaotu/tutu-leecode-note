题目：
ou are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

思路：
sort

代码：
class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(0,n+1-k):
            res = min(res,nums[i+k-1] - nums[i])
        return res
