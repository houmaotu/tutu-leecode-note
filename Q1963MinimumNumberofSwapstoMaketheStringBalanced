题目：
You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

思路：
数一数右在左前的数目
一个swap可以搞定两个 除二上取整即可

代码：
class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        leftct = 0
        for p in s:
            if p == "[":
                leftct += 1
            elif leftct == 0:
                res += 1
            else:
                leftct -= 1
                
     
        return (res-1)//2 + 1
