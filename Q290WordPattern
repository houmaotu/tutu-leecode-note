题目
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

代码：
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        ps = {}
        sp = {}
        
        pattern = [ch for ch in pattern]
        s = s.split(" ")
        
        if len(pattern) != len(s):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in sp and pattern[i] not in ps:
                sp[s[i]] = pattern[i]
                ps[pattern[i]] = s[i]
            if s[i] in sp and pattern[i] in ps and sp[s[i]] == pattern[i] and sp[s[i]] == pattern[i]:
                continue
            else:
                return False
            
        return True
