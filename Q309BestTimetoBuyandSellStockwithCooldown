题目：
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

思路：
其实就是个倒过来走的dp
第i天的 买 不理 卖 不利 
正着看就是个dfs 但是用cache存取来 这样子更好理解

代码：
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {}
        n = len(prices)
        def dfs(i,buy):
            if i >= len(prices):
                return 0
            if (i,buy) in dp:
                return dp[(i,buy)]
            if buy:
                buy = dfs(i + 1, not buy) - prices[i]
                cd = dfs(i + 1, buy)
                dp[(i,buy)] = max(buy,cd)
            else:
                sell = dfs(i + 2, not buy) + prices[i]
                cd = dfs(i + 1, buy)
                dp[(i,buy)] = max(sell,cd)
            return dp[(i,buy)]
        
        return dfs(0,True)
                
 知识点：
 dfs + cache是个更好理解的 dp
