题目：
You are given an array of strings nums and an integer k. Each string in nums represents an integer without leading zeros.

Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums.

Note: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if nums is ["1","2","2"], "2" is the first largest integer, "2" is the second-largest integer, and "1" is the third-largest integer.

思路：
heap
比order稍微快一丢丢

代码：
class Solution:
    def kthLargestNumber(self, nums: List[str], k: int) -> str:
        maxHeap = [-int(num) for num in nums]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
        
        while k>1:
            heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            k -= 1
            
        return str(-maxHeap[0]) 
        
知识点：
heapify 是linear的？
