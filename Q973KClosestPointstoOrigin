题目：
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

思路：
heap
order也成

代码：
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        minHeap = []
        for x,y in points:
            dist = x*x + y*y
            minHeap.append([dist,x,y])
        
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        res = []
        while k>0:
            dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res.append([x,y])
            k -= 1
            
        return res
