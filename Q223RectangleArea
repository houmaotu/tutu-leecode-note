题目：
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, ax1: int, ay1: int, ax2: int, ay2: int, bx1: int, by1: int, bx2: int, by2: int) -> int:
        aarea = (ax2-ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
        barea = (bx2-bx1) * (by2 - by1)
        
        overlap = 0
        
        if ax2 > bx1 and bx2 > ax1 and ay2 > by1 and by2 > ay1:
        
            xcollection = [ax1,ax2,bx1,bx2]
            ycollection = [ay1,ay2,by1,by2]
            xcollection.sort()
            ycollection.sort()
                        
            overlap = (xcollection[2] - xcollection[1]) * (ycollection[2] - ycollection[1])
        #print(aarea, barea, overlap)    
        return aarea + barea - overlap
