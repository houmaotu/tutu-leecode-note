题目：
You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order).
Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.


Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. 
The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue 
(queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

思路：
先放进去高个子 后放进去矮个子
因为队伍中记录了这个小子前面有多少人不低于他
那么：
后放进去的人 不影响前面已经进去人的k
所以 直接insert到k位置即可

注意 同归高度先排k小的也可满足上述条件


代码：
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        pp = {}
        for p in people:
            h = p[0]
            k = p[1]
            pp[h] = pp.get(h, []) + [k]
 
        q = []
        
        for h in sorted(pp.keys(),reverse = True):

            for k in sorted(pp[h]):
                q.insert(k,[h,k])
                
        return q

    妈蛋蛋 不要出脑筋急转弯了！
    厚毛兔只能写出来O（n^2）的！
    哼！
