题目：

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

        #1
        best - 0
        for l in xrange(len(height)):
            for r in xrange(l+1,len(height)):
            area = min (height[l],height[r]) * (r-1)
            best = max (best, area)
        return best
