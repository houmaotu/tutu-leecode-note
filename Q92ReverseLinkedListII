Question:
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, 
reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Idea:

There are three parts, the first part and thet hird past remain the same as the input, to we store pointers for these two parts.
For the second part, we have to reverse the link (storing them out in a list is a way, but needs more space), the way of reversing links is to
store the next, point the current to the previous, and move on. Below is an illustractrion:

        1 ->  2 -> 3  -> 4 -> 5  ->6  ->7  -> 8 ->9
                   L                    R
             
 goal   1  -> 2  3  <-4 <- 5  <-6 <- 7   8 ->  9
                 L                  R
       link three parts save pointers:
       p1                           p2
       
       p1-> r    l -> p1
            
            
      reverse arrow:
           3 -> 4 ->5
           p    c   t  store what's next
           p <- c         reverse link
           move on 
                p   c
     
     summary of the steps
      d ->  1 ->  2 -> 3  -> 4 -> 5  ->6  ->7  -> 8 ->9
                       L                    R       
     p      c                                                initialize
           
                  p    c                                     store
                       p    c                                start to reverse
                                      p    c                 last step of reversing
                                           p     c           finish reversing store
 
 代码：
 # Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        p = dummy
        c = dummy.next
        
        for _ in range(left - 1):
            p = p.next
            c = c.next
        
        p1 = p
        p2 = c
        
        p = p.next
        c = c.next
        
        for _ in range(right - left):
            t = c.next
            c.next = p
            p = c
            c = t
        
        p1.next = p
        p2.next = c
        
        return dummy.next

 Doing the leetcode in school is annoying, I must write in English. But a good thing is jutu won't see this line. Houmaotu is the biggest rabbit
 in the world. His wide jutu is a very cute rabbit, you can tell from her name. The smallest rabbit claimes she is huge. What a dumb cute little rabbit!
 
 别tm忘了写上代码！ 否则不仅仅说坏话被抓包 还能被逮住忘掉了！气死我了！
