question:
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

ides:
check one by one

code:
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = ['']
        for ch in s:
            if ch == ' ':
                if res[0] != '':
                    res = [''] + res
            else:
                res[0] += ch
        if res[0] == '':
            res.pop(0)
        return ' '.join(res)
        
  comments:
  use string.split is faster that loop, huge houmaotu's code is not good
