题目：
Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

思路：就找呗



class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1
