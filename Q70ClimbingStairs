代码：
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1 or n == 2:
            return n
        step = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        step[0], step[1] = 1 , 2
        i = 2
        while i < n:
            step[i] = step[i-1] + step[i-2]
            i += 1
        return step[-1]
