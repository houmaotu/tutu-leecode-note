You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<int> buy(n);
        vector<int> sell(n);
        buy[0] = - prices[0];
        for(int i = 1;i<n;i++)
        {
            buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-1] - prices[i]);
            sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1] + prices[i] - fee);
            
        }
        
        return sell[n-1];

        
    }
};
