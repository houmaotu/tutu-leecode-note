题目：
Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 

Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.

Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

 思路：
 还是走i j
 下一个heater是不是更近捏！
 更进则heater走
 否则houses 走并且更新r
 
 嗷呜嗷呜

代码：
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        i, j = 0, 0
        r = 0
        houses.sort()
        heaters.sort()
        while i < len(houses):
            if j + 1 < len(heaters) and abs(heaters[j + 1] - houses[i]) <= abs(heaters[j] - houses[i]):
                j += 1
            else:
                r = max(r,abs(heaters[j] - houses[i]))
                i += 1
            
        return r
   
   知识点：
   看人家讲的时候是简单 现在成了中等 哎 题目还可以改的 嗷呜呜
