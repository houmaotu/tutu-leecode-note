题目：
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

 思路：
 heap
 
 代码：
 class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        res = [0] * n
        minHeap = []
        for i,tmp in enumerate(temperatures):
            while minHeap and minHeap[0][0] < tmp:
                index = heapq.heappop(minHeap)[1]
                res[index] = i - index
            heapq.heappush(minHeap,(tmp,i))
        return res
        
 知识点：
 我总算会用heap咧
 也可以stack
 来了个新的 挨个pop monotone stack
