题目：
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        for a in asteroids:
            while stack and a<0 and stack[-1] > 0:
                diff = a + stack[-1]
                if diff < 0:
                    stack.pop()
                elif diff > 0:
                    a = 0
                else:
                    a = 0
                    stack.pop()
            if a:
                stack.append(a)
                    
        return stack
        
        
 思路：
 stack  因为次序不重要

        return stack
        
 知识点：
 为什么次序不重要呢！
