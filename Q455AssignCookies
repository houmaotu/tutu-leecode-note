题目：
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. 
Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

思路：
先排序
然后按照最大的饼干和要最大的饼干的人开始比较


代码：

class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        ct = 0
        s.sort()
        g.sort()
        i , j = len(g) - 1, len(s) - 1
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if s[j] < g[i]:
                i -= 1
            else:
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
                ct += 1
                
        return ct
