题目：
A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> List[str]:
        words = s1.split(" ") + s2.split(" ")
        allset = set()
        uncommonset = set()
        for word in words:
            if word in uncommonset:
                uncommonset.remove(word)
            elif word not in allset:
                allset.add(word)
                uncommonset.add(word)
        return [w for w in uncommonset]
